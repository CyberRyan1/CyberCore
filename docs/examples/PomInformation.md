# CyberCore pom.xml Information

This is how you would import CyberCore into your pom.xml (maven projects).

```xml
<!-- In the dependencies section -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.cyberryan1</groupId>
    <artifactId>CyberCore</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.1</version> <!-- Change this to the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

As of right now, there is no way to install CyberCore via a repository.
Therefore, for now, you will have to clone this repository and then run
the maven install command.
